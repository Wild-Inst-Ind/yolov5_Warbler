# YOLOv5 for Cryptic Warbler Detection

## Overview
YOLOv5, a powerful deep learning model, has significantly advanced image recognition, especially for detecting cryptic species like warblers. This document highlights its application to identify and classify warbler species within the *Phylloscopus burkii* complex, which are hard to distinguish due to their subtle physical differences.

## Access and Setup
The YOLOv5 repository, model, and dataset for this project are private and can be shared upon request. The dataset includes 289 annotated images, expanded to 2,890 images using augmentation techniques. The following provides a simplified overview of the process:

1. **Repository and Model**: Request access to the private repository for code and model details.
2. **Dataset Preparation**: The dataset is formatted for compatibility with YOLOv5. Assistance with setup can be provided upon request.
3. **Execution**: The system runs in a standard Python environment (Python 3.7 or higher), and guidance on dependencies and commands can be shared as needed.

## Key Model Features
To tackle the challenges of identifying cryptic *Phylloscopus* warblers, the YOLOv5 model has been enhanced with:

- **Part-Based Detection**: Separates part detection from classification, focusing on distinctive species features.
- **Robust Training**: Augmented datasets and optimized training on cloud platforms ensure high accuracy.

## Results
The model has demonstrated impressive performance:

- **Mean Average Precision (mAP)**: 94%
- **Recall**: 97.3%
- **Confidence Threshold**: Performs best at a threshold of 0.50.

Despite some overlap in identifying *P. valentini* and *P. tephrocephalus*, the model achieves excellent accuracy for *P. poliogenys* and *P. whistleri*.

## Applications and Recommendations
This model provides a robust framework for automated species identification, with practical applications including:

1. **Citizen Science**: Reducing errors in species identification for biodiversity data.
2. **Conservation**: Enhancing species monitoring and supporting ecological studies.
3. **Regional Models**: Future efforts to train region-specific models could further improve accuracy.

## Conclusion
By leveraging YOLOv5 with a targeted detection strategy, this project advances the automated identification of cryptic *Phylloscopus* warblers. These results demonstrate the potential of machine learning to support biodiversity research and conservation initiatives.
